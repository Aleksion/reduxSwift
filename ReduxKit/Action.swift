// MARK: Action protocol

/**
 Base action type all actions must conform to.

 The Action protocol is intentionally minimal to allow Action types to best fit their situation.

 If there are common properties needed on all Action types in you app, the Action protocol can be
 extended and each action can inherit from the new protocol instead. See FluxStandardAction for a
 good example of this in practice.
