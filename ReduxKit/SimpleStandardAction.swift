/**
 The SimpleStandardAction contains a strongly typed rawPayload property. It is generic and expects
 a rawPayload of a generic type.

 The protocol automatically assigns the rawPayload to the Actions payload property. This removes
 the necessity of type casting whenever working with actions in a reducer.

 There's also the StandardAction protocol, that requires the struct to have an initializer. This is
 required if the bindActionCreators helper is to be used.
