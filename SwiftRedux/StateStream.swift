 createSimpleStream returns an array based StateStream subscription service.

 Although it can be used to push new State objects to an existing reactive
 framework, it would be better to create a specific StateStream using your
 reactive framework as the provider.

 createSimpleStream does not handle locks and is not thread safe. These choices
 are left to your own implementation and often handled best by existing
 frameworks.
