## Cross promotion / pollination

> [\#13](https://github.com/ReduxKit/ReduxKit/issues/13): [@Ben-G](https://github.com/Ben-G) has done an awesome job of developing an independent, very idiomatic, swift implementation of Redux as [Swift-Flow](https://github.com/Swift-Flow/Swift-Flow).
>
> After a short discussion it's clear we all agree that collaboration and sharing of idea's will be beneficial to both projects. Go check it out. Feedback on both projects would be appreciated.

## Introduction

ReduxKit is a swift implementation of the JavaScript [Redux](http://rackt.github.io/redux) library by Dan Abramov and the React Community. ReduxKit stays as close as possible to Redux while bringing in Swift ways of doing things where appropriate.

A thorough walk through and description of the framework can be found at the official Redux repository: [Redux](http://rackt.github.io/redux).

It is currently implemented in a few swift apps and is frequently updated. Additions, middleware and help will be very much appreciated! So if you're trying it out and have any suggestions - feel free to post an issue and I'll be on it.
