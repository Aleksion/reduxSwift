## Progress

### TODO

The actual implementation of ReduxKit is fairly complete. More tooling is still required though.

- [x] Test and release reactive framework bindings
- [ ] Create the TODO app to showcase ease of use
- [ ] Documentation: How thorough should we do it? Core principles are very well described by Dan in his docs.
- [ ] Devtools. This is where the power of redux really shines - being able to undo states when testing will make developing and debugging so much easier.
