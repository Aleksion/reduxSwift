### How can you help?

Pull requests are welcome on the master branch.

I am hoping to get a solid influx of middleware up and running for ReduxKit so we can change the way we do iOS development in the future. I am therefore welcoming pull requests, feature requests and suggestions. I want this library to be the best it can be and I can only do that with the help of the rest of you.
