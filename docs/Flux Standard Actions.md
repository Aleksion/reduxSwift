# Flux Standard Actions

ReduxKit `Action`s are implemented as [Flux Standard Actions](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action). Defining an Action protocol with ReduxKit makes interacting with the Store and State easier. FSA allows for a lot of flexibility while still maintaining a standard pattern.

See [Actions](Actions.html) for further documentation.
