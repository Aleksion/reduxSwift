### Intro
Swift-Redux is a swift implementation of rackt/redux by Dan Abramov and the React Community.
I am currently implementing this in a few swift apps so it will be frequently updated. Additions, middlewares and help will be very much appreciated!

The following is the Gist section from the official Redux readme - I will update the project with examples and documentation shortly.  

### The Gist

The whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single *store*.  
The only way to change the state tree is to emit an *action*, an object describing what happened.  
To specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write pure *reducers*.
